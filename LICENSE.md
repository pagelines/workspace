# LICENSE
============

1. This License grants you, the purchaser, an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the digital work (Theme) you have selected. Read the rest of this license for the details that apply to your use of the Theme.

2. You are licensed to use the Theme to create one single End Product for yourself or for one client (a “single application”), and the End Product cannot be distributed for Free.

3. An End Product is a customised implementation of the Theme.

4. You can create one End Product for a client, and you can transfer that single End Product to your client for any fee. This license is then transferred to your client.

5. You can make any number of copies of the single End Product, but you cannot distribute the End Product either for free or for sale.

6. You can modify or manipulate the Theme. You can combine the Theme with other works and make a derivative work from it. The resulting works are subject to the terms of this license. You can do these things as long as the End Product you then create is one that’s permitted under clause 3.

7. You can’t Sell the End Product, except to one client. (If you or your client want to Sell the End Product, you will need an Extended License.)

8. You can’t re-distribute the Theme as stock, in a tool or template, or with source files. You can’t do this with a Theme either on its own or bundled with other items, and even if you modify the Theme. You can’t re-distribute or make available the Theme as-is or with superficial modifications. These things are not allowed even if the re-distribution is for Free.

9. Although you can modify the Theme and therefore delete unwanted components before creating your single End Product, you can’t extract and use a single component of a Theme on a stand-alone basis. 

10. You must not permit an end user of the End Product to extract the Theme and use it separately from the End Product.

11. You can’t use elements of the Theme in a logo, trademark, or service mark.

12. For some Themes, a component of the Theme will be sourced by the author from elsewhere and different license terms may apply to the component, such as someone else’s license or an open source or creative commons license. If so, the component will be identified by the author in the Theme’s description page or in the Theme’s downloaded files. The other license will apply to that component instead of this license. This license will apply to the rest of the Theme.

13. For some items within a Theme, a GNU General Public License (GPL) or another open source license applies. The open source license applies in the following ways:

	(a) Some Themes, even if entirely created by the author, may be partially subject to the open source license: a ‘split license’ applies. This means that the open source license applies to an extent that’s determined by the open source license terms and the nature of the Theme, and this license applies to the rest of the Theme.  Split and other open source licensing is relevant for themes and plug-ins for WordPress and other open source platforms. Where split licensing applies, this is noted in the Theme’s download files: for more information, see this Knowledge Base article

	(b) For some Themes, the author may have chosen to apply a GPL license to the entire Theme. This means that the relevant GPL license will apply to the entire Theme instead of this license.  Where a Theme is entirely under a GPL license, it will be identified as a GPL item and the license noted in the download files.

14. You can only use the Theme for lawful purposes. Also, if a Theme contains an image of a person, even if the Theme is model-released you can’t use it in a way that creates a fake identity, implies personal endorsement of a product by the person, or in a way that is defamatory, obscene or demeaning, or in connection with sensitive subjects.

15. Themes that contain digital versions of real products, trademarks or other intellectual property owned by others have not been property released. These items are licensed on the basis of editorial use only. It is your responsibility to consider whether your use of these items requires a clearance and if so, to obtain that clearance from the intellectual property rights owner.

16. This license can be terminated if you breach it. If that happens, you must stop making copies of or distributing the End Product until you remove the Theme from it.

17. The author of the Theme retains ownership of the Theme but grants you the license on these terms. This license is between the author of the Theme and you.
